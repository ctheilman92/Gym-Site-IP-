    SwoleFrog has been serving as Texas A&M University Corpus Christi Off-Campus Gym since 1993 and is considered to be the “Cheers” of fitness because we truly do know your name. It is the longest running independently owned full-service gym in T.X. Our unique gym combines the personal attention and member service of a boutique gym with the fitness options of a large club including full service locker rooms with all the amenities and a filtered water fountain.

We not only pride ourselves on our warm and inviting facility and the quality of service we provide, but on the community that we have built here. Our commitment to being socially responsible is evident in the variety of ways that we have given back to small and large, local, national and international organizations. <br /> <br />

SwoleFrog stands out because it has the highest quality of classes and staff in the area. We are proud that GymLord still has members who originally joined in 1993. Our staff is among the most committed and we have the lowest employee turnover of any fitness company. We are proud of our tradition and dedication to quality, with member service as our top priority.
